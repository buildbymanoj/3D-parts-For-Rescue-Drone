# ZMR250 Drone – 3D Printed Parts

This repository contains simple 3D printed parts that I designed using **Fusion 360** for my **ZMR250 drone frame** project.

These parts were created as utility components to support our drone build during a competition.

## 🧩 Parts Designed

- Landing Gear – Basic support legs to increase ground clearance  
- **Component Holders** – Simple holders for mounting or organizing small parts  

---

## 🏆 Achievement

This drone project helped us win **Second Place (1st Runner-Up)** in a drone competition.  
The custom parts played a small but useful role in improving the design.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Fusion 360** – for creating 3D models  
- **3D Printer** – for printing the parts

---

## 📌 Note

All parts are simple and functional, made specifically for the **ZMR250** frame.  
Shared here for reference and further use.
